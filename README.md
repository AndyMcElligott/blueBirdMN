Duration: 3 Week Sprint

BlueBirdMN is a ski and snowboard hill look-up tool for hills in MN. First-time users will need to create a username and a password via the registration page while returning users can login with their already established names and passwords. Users can create profiles which describe them and their respected riding style, experience and location. This can be edited as time goes to better reflect styles, location or years of experience. From there users can view ski hills in MN by clicking on the Local Hills tab. From there cards of various hills can be viewed by name, and a drop down arrow expands to show a brief summary of the hill. Users can obtain more info by clicking on the ‘more info’ button to get prices, hours, total number of runs open, and a trail map. To get the most up-to-date info users can view the hills live-cam feeds by clicking on the corresponding tab. For info from other users who have recently frequented the hill there is an additional tab called User Testimony. Users even view YouTube videos other users have submitted and even submit their YouTube videos taken from mobile devices to show what current conditions outside of the already mentioned information are truly like.
